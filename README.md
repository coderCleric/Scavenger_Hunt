# Outer Wilds Ventures Scavenger Hunt
It looks like all of the travelers of Outer Wilds Ventures have teamed up to make a special scavenger hunt just for their newest astronaut! Each of the travelers has placed a clue somewhere in the solar system. Each clue gives a hint as to where the next one is, as well as part of the combination to open the new clockwork vault in the village! Will you follow the clues and discover what treasure lies within the vault?<br />
