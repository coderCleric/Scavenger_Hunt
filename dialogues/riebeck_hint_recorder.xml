      <Page>H-hey, hatchling! Hope you’re doing well! Although, I guess you listening to this means that you have to at least be alive, right?</Page>
      <Page>Unless you, like, crashed nearby and some rubble hit the play button, in which case you totally might be dead. Ah, I’m rambling again, sorry.</Page>
      <Page>Anyway, the next button you need to press is the, um,  right one… again. I would say the last button you need to press but, um, surprise! You actually still have one more hint to find. I would tell you who from but, uh, they asked that I keep it a surprise.</Page>
      <Page>When I get scared out here, in space I mean, one of the big things that helps me is that I can pull out my signalscope, listen to the other travelers, and know I’m not alone.</Page>
      <Page>I know that that’s, well, really sappy, but I really do mean it, and I wanted to involve that in where I hid the last recording. So, um, I put it at Esker’s favorite spot to listen to the other travelers. S-stay safe hatchling!</Page>
