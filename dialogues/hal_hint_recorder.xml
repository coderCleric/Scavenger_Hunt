      <Page>Aw, c’mon buddy, you didn’t really think you weren’t gonna hear from your buddy Hal, did you?</Page>
      <Page>When I was walking by the museum a couple months ago and heard all of the travelers planning this, I knew that I had to get in on it.</Page>
      <Page>I mean seriously, we’ve been best buds since we were hatchlings, I’m borderline insulted that they didn’t ask for me to participate!</Page>
      <Page>...Not really, of course, I know that there’s a certain camaraderie that you travelers have that doesn’t quite extend to the ground crew, so it makes sense that they wanted to do something for ya.</Page>
      <Page>I’m honestly actually kinda flattered with how quickly they roped me into it once I asked.</Page>
      <Page>... I know that it’s a big system out there, and a small village down here, but don’t forget about me, okay? I know exploring space and finally having a good translator to figure out what the Nomai were all about is a really big deal, but we’ve been such close friends for so long and, y’know…</Page>
      <Page>That’s a big deal to me, probably one of the biggest deals.</Page>
      <Page>Anyway, aahhh I’m running out of tape, the last part of the combo is the middle button okayflysafeby-</Page>
      <Page>The recording ends abruptly as it reaches the end of the tape.</Page>
